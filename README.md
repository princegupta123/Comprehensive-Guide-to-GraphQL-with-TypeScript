# Comprehensive Guide to GraphQL with TypeScript: File Structure and GUI

GraphQL has gained immense popularity in recent years for its flexibility in querying data. It allows clients to request exactly what they need, minimizing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. In this article, we'll dive into the key concepts of GraphQL with a little project, and how to use a GraphQL GUI.

## 1. Introduction to GraphQL
GraphQL allows clients to specify the structure of the response. Instead of having multiple endpoints like in REST, a GraphQL server exposes a single endpoint, and clients can query it to get exactly what they need.

Key Benefits:
- **Efficient data fetching:** Fetch multiple resources in a single request.
- **Strongly typed:** GraphQL is strongly typed, and you define your data structure in the schema.
- **Client-specific queries:** The client decides what data it needs, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching.

Example of a GraphQL query:
```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    id
    firstName
    email
  }
}
```
